# python-base-repo
An example repository for Python projects that aims to use some of the best software development practices.

## Dependencies
* Python >= 3.10
* Anaconda >= 4.10

## Setup 
1. Clone or download this repo. `cd` yourself to it's root directory.
2. Set up a Python virtual enviromnent, e.g. using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) this can be achieved with:

`$ conda create python=3.10 --name ${env}`

`$ conda activate ${env}`

4. Install dependencies, using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Install test dependencies, using `pip install -r requirement-test.txt`
6. Test the setup by running `python -m pytest -v`

We suggest using [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) as an IDE. After following above steps, create a new project in Pycharm with previously configured interpreter (select virtual environment from step 2 above).
